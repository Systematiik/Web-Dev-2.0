			<h1>Computer Parts</h1>

				<p>You may be wondering, what kind of hardware do I need to build a <b>computer?</b></p>
					<p>A video will be provided at the bottom of the screen.</p>

			<h3>You will need the following: </h3>

				<ul>
					<li>CPU</li>
					<li>Motherboard</li>
					<li>RAM</li>
					<li>GPU</li>
					<li>Case</li>
					<li>Hard Drive</li>

			<h1>CPU</h1>

				<p> A <b><em>CPU</em></b> is the electonic circuitry witin a computer that caries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control an input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.

				<p><img src="cpu.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="right"></p>

					<p>Some facts about CPU: <ol type="i">
						<li>Over the years, CPU has different implentation, design and form.</li>
						<li>The logic and arithmetic operations are under the responsibility of ALU or arithmetic logic unit. The other ones include a control unit and processor registers.</li>
						<li>A multi-core processor can be found in several computers. Therefore, you can find two or more central processing units on the single chip.</li>
						<li>If you check the bits of the modern central processing unit, it gas 8, 16, 32, or even 64 bits.</li>

			<h1>Motherboard</h1>

				<p>A <b><em>motherboard</em></b> (sometimes alternatively known as tthe mainboard, system board, baseboard, planar board or logic board, or colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in gerneral purpose microcomputers and other expandable systmes. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.</p>

				<p><img src="motherboard.png" width="300" height="200" align="right"></p>

There are a number of different standard expansion slots including: Industry Standard Architecture (ISA), Peripgeral Component Interconnect (PCI) and Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP).</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Onboard<br> Components</td>
							<td>Many motherboards include onboard devices (such as network cards, audio cards, video cards, or USB and Firewire connections). Selecting a motherboard with onboard devices is typically cheaperr than buying seperate expansion cards for each feature.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Onboard Internal<br> Connectors</td>
							<td>There are a number of connectors for components such as power supply, fans, and LED lights. In addition, many motherboards provide additional ports, such as USB or Infrared, by attaching adapter cards to the motherboard connectors (also call <em>headers</em>. These connectors are often labeled on the surface of the motherboard.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>BIOS Chip</td>
							<td>The BIOS chip is firmware (hardware hard-coded with software) attached to the motherboard and is essential in booting the computer.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>CMOS Battery</td>
							<td>The CMOS battery supplies power to the CMOS to retain system settings used by the BIOS during system boot.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Chipset</td>
							<td>The <em>chipset</em> is a group of chips that facilitate communication between the processor, memory components, and peripheral devices. The chipset controls the bus speed and alo power management features. Chipsets are usually attached to the motherboard and are non-upgradeable.</td>

						<tr>
							<td>Jumpers</td>
							<td><em>Jumpers</em> are e;ectrical connection points that can be set to control devices and functions attached to the motherboard.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>

			<h1>RAM</h1>

				<p><b><em>Random-access memory(RAM)</em></b>, is a form of computer data storage that stores data and maching code currently being used.</p>

			<p><img src="ram.jpg" width="300" height="150" align="right"></p>

				<p>Here are some facts about RAM: <ol type="A">
					<li>RAM has nothing to do with the amount of file storage a hard drive has, even though the two are often incorrectly interchanged with each other in conversation.</li>
					<li>A standard "<em>module</em>" or "<em>stick</em>" of desktop memory is a long, thin piece of hardware that resembles a short ruler.</li>
					<li>The amount of memory you need for your computer depends on what you use, or plan to use, your computer for.</li>
					<li>Though RAM is explained as a volatile memory in the context of this website (with regard to internal computer memory), RAM also exists in a non-volatile, non-alterable form called read-only memory (ROM).</li>

			<h1>GPU</h1>

				<p>A <b><em>graphics processing unit (GPU)</em></b> is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intenderd for output to a display device.</p>

			<h1>Case</h1>

				<p>A <b><em>computer case</em></b> or also known as a <b><em>computer chassis</em></b>, tower,system unit, cabinet, base unit, or simply <b><em>case</em></b>, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard and mouse.)</p>

					<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Jexjz8EML._SX355_.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right"></p>

					<p>These are some names of the different sized computer cases: <ul>

						<li><b>Full Tower</b>
							<ul><li>Full-Tower cases are generally big with a height that is about or more than 30 inches (more than 76 cm). The number of internal drive bays inside these cases can be between 6 and 10.</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Mid Tower</b>
							<ul><li>Mid-tower cases are the most widely used computer cases. Mid tower cases are about 18 to 24 (45 to 60 cm) inches high and they usually contain 2 to 4 internal drive bays and a similar number external bays (for CD/DBD readers and similar).</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Mini Tower</b>
							<ul><li>Mini-tower usually have up to 2 or sometimes 3 internal drive bays. Mini-cases normally stand at a height of 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm). Expandability is a problem with these cases.</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Slim Line Case</b>
							<ul><li>Slim line cases are simply tower cases turned on their sideways. They can hold a monitor on top of the case.</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Small Form Factor (SFF) Case</b>
							<ul><li>Small for factor or SFF cases are custom case that are designed to minimize the spatial volume of a desktop computer. SFFs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, including shoe boxes, cubes, and book-sized PCs.</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Motherboard Form Factor</b>
							<ul><li>There's one important consideration we need to be aware of when choosing the case size and that is the size of the motherboard. They need to match. The size of the motherboard is often called the Form Factor and there are several standards.</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>ATX From Factor (Full ATX)</b>
							<ul><li>Probalby the most common form factor for a motherboard is the ATX form factor. The board is approximately 12" x 9.6" (30cm x 24cm).</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Mini ATX</b>
							<ul><li>A mini-ATX motherboard is a slightly smaller variation of the full ATX size that measeures 11.2" x 8.2" (28cm x 21cm). The main difference between ATX and mini-ATX is the number of buses and possibly memory slots on the motherboard.</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Micro ATX</b>
							<ul><li>The micro-ATX form factor is an even smaller version of the ATX standard, with a maximum size of 9.6" x 9.6" (24cm x 24cm). The faceplate line up to the exact same position as in all other versions of ATX.</li></ul>
						</li>

						<li><b>Flex ATX</b>
							<ul><li>The size of the Flex ATX is 9" x 7.5" (22.9 cm x 19.1 cm). It is derived from Micro ATX and is used in small computer cases.</li></ul>
						</li>
